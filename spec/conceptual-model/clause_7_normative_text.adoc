== GeoPackage Conceptual Model
This section presents the normative definition of the GeoPackage Conceptual Model.
UML diagrams are provided to aid in understanding.
The diagrams are intended to be normative, but if there is any discrepancy between the diagrams and the text then the text takes priority.

[NOTE]
====
Requirements are numbered to maintain alignment with OGC 12-128.
====

=== Core
A GeoPackage contains the content represented in <<Core_Classes>>.

[#Core_Classes,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.Core GeoPackage Classes

include::requirements/requirements_class_core.adoc[]

=== Features

GeoPackages that conform to the Features Requirements class contain the content represented in <<Features_Classes>>.

[#Features_Classes,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.Features GeoPackage Classes

include::requirements/requirements_class_features.adoc[]

=== Tiles

GeoPackages that conform to the Tiles Requirements class contain the content represented in <<Tiles_Classes>>.

[#Tiles_Classes,reftext='{figure-caption} {counter:figure-num}']
.Tiles GeoPackage Classes

include::requirements/requirements_class_tiles.adoc[]

=== Attributes

GeoPackages that conform to the Attributes Requirements class contain the content represented in <<Attributes_Classes>>.

[NOTE]
====
OGC 12-128 defined this concept as "attributes".
However, this conflicts with the standard definition of an attribute as a member of a class.
In this document, the term "attributes set" will be used to describe a user-defined class with multiple attributes and no geometry.

==== Requirement 1
Paragraph - intro text for the requirement.

Use the following table for Requirements, number sequentially.

Dictionary tables for requirements can be added as necessary. Modify the following example as needed.
